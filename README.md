# code-marks 

code-marks provides features to create and jump to marks throughout your code.

## Features

Create, clear, list, and jump to marks throughout your code using either commands or key strokes.

Provides the Following Commands:  
- Create Mark
    - After running the create mark command Code Marks will wait for another key to be pressed. If it is a lowercase letter, code marks will create a local mark for the current file. If it is an uppercase letter, code marks will create a global mark. Local marks can only be accessed in the file they were created in. Creating a mark with the same binding and location as a previous mark will clear that mark instead.
- Jump To Mark
    - See Create Mark description for usage. This command just jumps to a mark instead of creating one.
- List Marks
- Delete Mark From List
- Clear all Marks
